# Cosmic Whisper 
## A Proof-of-Concept for Potential Extraterrestrial Communication
This project explores the possibility of potential ET communication by the transmission of musical notes using an Arduino and an RF module. The system comprises of a transmitter and a receiver, both built on Arduino platforms.
- **Key features**:
  - *Musical Note Transmission*: Transmits a set of predefined musical notes wirelessly using an RF module.
  - *Arduino-Based*: Utilizes the Arduino platform for easy prototyping and customization.
  - *Proof-of-Concept*: Demonstrates the feasibility of transmitting simple signals for potential extraterrestrial communication.
- **Future Work**:
  - Expand to a wide range of frequencies.
  - Investigate the use of different communication protocols.
  - Implement more complex modulation techniques for improved signal robustness.
